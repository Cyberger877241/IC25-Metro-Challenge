Here's some information for clarification:

- All code was done in Kaggle Notebooks, and several graphs were made in Microsoft Excel.

- In the "ic25-mindpetal-dc-metro-analysis.ipynb" file: The plotly dashboards do not display in the preview, but after running the code and selecting any of the 98 WMATA stations of your choice, the graphs  will show up!

- In the "Clean Mindpetal WMATA_Ridership_Summary Kavin M.csv" used, the file contains the original ridership dataset provided by Mindpetal, with an added "Date" column, and all of the entries merged into one datasheet
