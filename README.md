# IC25-Metro-Challenge
IC25 Group 30

Here's some information for clarification:

- All code was done in Kaggle Notebooks
  
- In the "ic25-mindpetal-dc-metro-analysis.ipynb" file: The plotly dashboards do not show, but after running the code and selecting any of the 98 WMATA stations of your choice, the graphs  will show up!
